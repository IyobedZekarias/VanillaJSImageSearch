# VanillaJSImageSearch

This is a simple serach application that uses NASA's Mars rover API. The user needs to enter a number up to 1000.
The api has a value for the sol, given by the user, and will return all the photos taken by the curiosity rover on said sol.
Once the array is returned of all the links to the images the javascript program goes through and puts all the images on the screen.
